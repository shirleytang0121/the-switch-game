Switch game rules

4-person rule

Ready to work
52 cards (no size king) & 4 different pieces

Each player draws a card, the smallest one is Zhuang

If there is a minimum at the same time, the few people who draw the tie will draw again until the smallest one appears.

Note: A maximum

After shuffling, the dealer draws 36 cards and arranges them in 6*6. The cards face up.

Each player's piece is placed on the leftmost card in the first row in front of them.

Moving rule

The first step starts with the player on the left side of the dealer and goes to the left wheel (clockwise)

The player can move any number of cells in the row or column he is in.

Can't move diagonally

Can't cross or stay on the grid of other players

When the player’s piece stays on a card, the card belongs to the player.

Player's cards will be placed face up in front of you

Even if the card has been taken, the 6*6 format still exists and the player can stay in the space.

When the player stays in the space, the player does not get any cards.

Each player must move at least one space per round

Unless the player is blocked by another player, the opportunity to move this round is lost.

Each player can't stay in place in the first round to get the cards on the ground.

Special circumstances: When the dealer is blocked by other players in the first round, he can take the cards on his place.

Alliance/competition rules

Player A can move between player B and the card he wants to get, blocking player B to take the card (or player A takes the 
card directly)

Players can announce an alliance with another player before it is his turn to move.

Players selected as allies of the player may not refuse

The other two players also automatically become alliances.

There is only one chance to announce the league in each game (a game, it should play at least three innings)

After the league, teammates still need to take cards for themselves (the cards of the two are not combined)

The main strategy of cooperation is

Help teammates block the enemy and let teammates take cards

Be the first to take off the cards the enemy wants

End authority

In theory, when all cards are taken away by the player, or blocked, no one can get it, the game is over.

In fact, players can stop the authorities if they find they are in an unstoppable position

Players can choose to end this game early if they find that they are in an unmatchable situation.

The winner of the game is the player who made the highest card (5 cards)

If you tie, no one scores → will play another game

After a game is in good condition, after the card is shuffled, draw the cards again.

Scoring rules

Players should try to make a high-profile

The following cards are from top to bottom, and the scores are from high to low.

Straight flush

Four

Three belt two

same color

Straight

Three

Double pair

Pair

Straight Flush and Straight score the highest score

Four, three and pair of high scores in the largest card in the combination

Three bands and two with three of the biggest cards to score high points

The same flower and double pair score the highest score

If the biggest card is the same, then compare the second largest card

If the values are the same, then the tie

Flowers are not included in the score, all colors are equal

A is always the biggest, except in the straight A-2-3-4-5

Score per game

A chooses B as a teammate

If B wins, B gets 7 points and A gets 3 points.

If A wins, neither of them will score.

Hostile C wins, C gets 6 points, and his teammate D gets 4 points.

If the AB surrenders in advance, the current cards of C and D will be calculated, with 6 points for the high score and 4 

points for the other.

If the CD surrenders in advance, B gets 7 points and A gets 3 points.

If no one chooses the league in this game, the player who wins will get 10 points.

Whole game scoring rules

When the player has 16 points or more, he has the ability to move his own and his teammate's pieces.

The player can choose to move his or his teammate's pieces in each round, and the cards obtained are owned by the player.

If both teammates have more than 16 points, then they have no power to use this special ability.

The winner of 20 points is the winner of this game

When the two scored 20 points or more after the end of the same game, the highest scorer is the winner of the game.

If it is even, then play another game.

Note: After playing another game, it is possible that another player gets a high score and gets the highest score in the game.

2-person rule

25 cards in 5*5

Two players face each other, and the pieces are placed on the leftmost card in the first row in front of them.

10 points for each player with the highest card number
