You can\r\n * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling\r\n * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your\r\n * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.\r\n * \r\n * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.\r\n * \r\n * The Triangle consists of 3 lines, joining up to form a triangular shape. You can control the\r\n * position of each point of these lines. The triangle is always closed and cannot have an open\r\n * face. If you require that, consider using a Polygon instead.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#triangle\r\n * @since 3.13.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [x1=0] - The horizontal position of the first point in the triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [y1=128] - The vertical position of the first point in the triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [x2=64] - The horizontal position of the second point in the triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [y2=0] - The vertical position of the second point in the triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [x3=128] - The horizontal position of the third point in the triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [y3=128] - The vertical position of the third point in the triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [fillColor] - The color the triangle will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.\r\n * @param {number} [fillAlpha] - The alpha the triangle will be filled with.
