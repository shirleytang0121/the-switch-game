So, to listen for\r\n * the change of a specific data item from a Game Object you would use: `sprite.data.on('changedata-key', listener)`,\r\n * where `key` is the unique string key of the data item. For example, if you have a data item stored called `gold`\r\n * then you can listen for `sprite.data.on('changedata-gold')`.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Data.Events#CHANGE_DATA_KEY\r\n * \r\n * @param {any} parent - A reference to the object that owns the instance of the Data Manager responsible for this event.\r\n * @param {string} key - The unique key of the data item within the Data Manager.\r\n * @param {any} value - The item that was updated in the Data Manager. This can be of any data type, i.e. a string, boolean, number, object or instance.\r\n * @param {any} previousValue - The previous item that was updated in the Data Manager. This can be of any data type, i.e. a string, boolean, number, object or instance.\r\n */\nmodule.exports = 'changedata-';","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
