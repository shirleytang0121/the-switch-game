You can\r\n * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling\r\n * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your\r\n * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.\r\n * \r\n * This shape supports only stroke colors and cannot be filled.\r\n * \r\n * A Line Shape allows you to draw a line between two points in your game. You can control the\r\n * stroke color and thickness of the line. In WebGL only you can also specify a different\r\n * thickness for the start and end of the line, allowing you to render lines that taper-off.\r\n * \r\n * If you need to draw multiple lines in a sequence you may wish to use the Polygon Shape instead.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#line\r\n * @since 3.13.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [x1=0] - The horizontal position of the start of the line.\r\n * @param {number} [y1=0] - The vertical position of the start of the line.\r\n * @param {number} [x2=128] - The horizontal position of the end of the line.\r\n * @param {number} [y2=0] - The vertical position of the end of the line.\r\n * @param {number} [strokeColor] - The color the line will be drawn in, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.\r\n * @param {number} [strokeAlpha] - The alpha the line will be drawn in. You can also set the alpha of the overall Shape using its `alpha` property.\r\n *\r\n * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.Line} The Game Object that was created.\r\n */\n\n\nGameObjectFactory.register('line', function (x, y, x1, y1, x2, y2, strokeColor, strokeAlpha) {\n  return this.displayList.add(new Line(this.scene, x, y, x1, y1, x2, y2, strokeColor, strokeAlpha));\n});","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
