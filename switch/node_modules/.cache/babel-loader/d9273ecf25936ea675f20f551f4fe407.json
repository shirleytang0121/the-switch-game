This callback allows you to manipulate the properties of\r\n * each letter being rendered, such as its position, scale or tint, allowing you to create interesting effects\r\n * like jiggling text, which can't be done with Static text. This means that Dynamic Text takes more processing\r\n * time, so only use them if you require the callback ability they have.\r\n *\r\n * BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability\r\n * to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by\r\n * processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.\r\n *\r\n * To create multi-line text insert \\r, \\n or \\r\\n escape codes into the text string.\r\n *\r\n * To create a BitmapText data files you need a 3rd party app such as:\r\n *\r\n * BMFont (Windows, free): http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/\r\n * Glyph Designer (OS X, commercial): http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner\r\n * Littera (Web-based, free): http://kvazars.com/littera/\r\n *\r\n * For most use cases it is recommended to use XML. If you wish to use JSON, the formatting should be equal to the result of\r\n * converting a valid XML file through the popular X2JS library. An online tool for conversion can be found here: http://codebeautify.org/xmltojson\r\n *\r\n * Note: This method will only be available if the Dynamic Bitmap Text Game Object has been built into Phaser.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#dynamicBitmapText\r\n * @since 3.0.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} x - The x position of the Game Object.\r\n * @param {number} y - The y position of the Game Object.\r\n * @param {string} font - The key of the font to use from the BitmapFont cache.\r\n * @param {(string|string[])} [text] - The string, or array of strings, to be set as the content of this Bitmap Text.\r\n * @param {number} [size] - The font size to set.\r\n *\r\n * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.DynamicBitmapText} The Game Object that was created.\r\n */\n\n\nGameObjectFactory.register('dynamicBitmapText', function (x, y, font, text, size) {\n  return this.displayList.add(new DynamicBitmapText(this.scene, x, y, font, text, size));\n}); //  When registering a factory function 'this' refers to the GameObjectFactory context.\n//\n//  There are several properties available to use:\n//\n//  this.scene - a reference to the Scene that owns the GameObjectFactory\n//  this.displayList - a reference to the Display List the Scene owns\n//  this.updateList - a reference to the Update List the Scene owns","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
