This happens when the animation changes frame,\r\n * based on the animation frame rate and other factors like `timeScale` and `delay`.\r\n * \r\n * Listen for it on the Sprite using `sprite.on('animationupdate-key', listener)` where `key` is the key of\r\n * the animation. For example, if you had an animation with the key 'explode' you should listen for `animationupdate-explode`.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Animations.Events#SPRITE_ANIMATION_KEY_UPDATE\r\n * \r\n * @param {Phaser.Animations.Animation} animation - A reference to the Animation that has updated on the Sprite.\r\n * @param {Phaser.Animations.AnimationFrame} frame - The current Animation Frame of the Animation.\r\n * @param {Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite} gameObject - A reference to the Game Object on which the animation updated.\r\n */\nmodule.exports = 'animationupdate-';","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
