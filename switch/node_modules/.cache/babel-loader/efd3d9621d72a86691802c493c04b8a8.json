You can\r\n * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling\r\n * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your\r\n * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.\r\n * \r\n * This shape supports only fill colors and cannot be stroked.\r\n * \r\n * An IsoTriangle is an 'isometric' triangle. Think of it like a pyramid. Each face has a different\r\n * fill color. You can set the color of the top, left and right faces of the triangle respectively\r\n * You can also choose which of the faces are rendered via the `showTop`, `showLeft` and `showRight` properties.\r\n * \r\n * You cannot view an IsoTriangle from under-neath, however you can change the 'angle' by setting\r\n * the `projection` property. The `reversed` property controls if the IsoTriangle is rendered upside\r\n * down or not.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#isotriangle\r\n * @since 3.13.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [size=48] - The width of the iso triangle in pixels. The left and right faces will be exactly half this value.\r\n * @param {number} [height=32] - The height of the iso triangle. The left and right faces will be this tall. The overall height of the iso triangle will be this value plus half the `size` value.\r\n * @param {boolean} [reversed=false] - Is the iso triangle upside down?\r\n * @param {number} [fillTop=0xeeeeee] - The fill color of the top face of the iso triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [fillLeft=0x999999] - The fill color of the left face of the iso triangle.\r\n * @param {number} [fillRight=0xcccccc] - The fill color of the right face of the iso triangle.\r\n *\r\n * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.IsoTriangle} The Game Object that was created.\r\n */\n\n\nGameObjectFactory.register('isotriangle', function (x, y, size, height, reversed, fillTop, fillLeft, fillRight) {\n  return this.displayList.add(new IsoTriangle(this.scene, x, y, size, height, reversed, fillTop, fillLeft, fillRight));\n});","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
