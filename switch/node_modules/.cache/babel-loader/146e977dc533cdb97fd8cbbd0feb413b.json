Once way to get this is from the `pad1`, `pad2`, etc properties on the Gamepad Plugin:\r\n * `this.input.gamepad.pad1.on('up', listener)`.\r\n * \r\n * Note that you will not receive any Gamepad button events until the browser considers the Gamepad as being 'connected'.\r\n * \r\n * You can also listen for an UP event from the Gamepad Plugin. See the [BUTTON_UP]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#event:BUTTON_UP} event for details.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#GAMEPAD_BUTTON_UP\r\n * \r\n * @param {integer} index - The index of the button that was released.\r\n * @param {number} value - The value of the button at the time it was released. Between 0 and 1. Some Gamepads have pressure-sensitive buttons.\r\n * @param {Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Button} button - A reference to the Button which was released.\r\n */\nmodule.exports = 'up';","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
